        This is a really cool boombox. I cannot stress enough. I know absolutely
        nothing about this boombox, other than that is is sick. Looks like it
        has a speaker on it. Sick. I don't know what those knobs are for but I'm
        into it. That handle looks great for throwing it across the room. Bet it
        wouldn't even break. I'm not even really sure what it does, says a
        "radio cassette recorder" but it also works as a bluetooth radio. What
        all is this radio hiding. Reddit says you can plug a USB flash drive in
        to record onto cassettes through the flash drive. I don't know who uses
        cassettes anymore bu that is a pretty sick function. Very cool radio.
        Would buy it for my grandmother. Mindless rambling out of 10. Just typed
        this out and realized it wasn't long enough. I can't emphasize enough
        how cool this radio is. it may have just been a free glb model I found
        on the internet that already had a texture, but that's what makes it
        perfect. This radio is a perfect demonstration of humanity's
        selflessness. Whoever uploaded his onto the internet took their time to
        put it there and allowed me to download it to use for free and saved me
        about 5 minutes time of finding another good example model. This would
        not have been possible without this radio. Matter of fact, it should
        receive a nobel peace prize as a result of its' existence.
